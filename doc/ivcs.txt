===============================================================================
Compatibility                           *ivcs-compatibility*

IVCS requires neovim >= 0.7. Please run `:checkhealth ivcs` to see if current
neovim version is supported.

===============================================================================
USAGE                                   *ivcs-usage*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND                                 *ivcs-command*

With the git module setup, IVCS provides the command |:IGit|. The command name
is customizable (|ivcs-customization|). Except for certain special commands
described in |ivcs-page|, |IGit| takes arbitrary git commands and run them
asynchronously in shell. Output/error of the commands will be echoed on
completion. When executed with a |bang| modifier (|:IGit!|), even the special
page commands are run in this manner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAGE                                    *ivcs-page*

The git commands `log`, `status`, `branch` are three special commands. Unlike
other commands, their output by default are dumped into a vim buffer which I
call it a page. Another difference to other commands is that with no |cmdline|
arguments, some default arguments (customizable, see |ivcs-customization|) are
applied to give sensible default behavior. Any non-empty |cmdline| argument will
completely bypass the default arguments so that one could have several different
page corresponding to different arguments.

The `branch` and `status` pages by default auto reload on |BufEnter|. On the
other hand, the `log` page does not auto reloads by default (customizable, see
|ivcs-customization|). However, running `:edit` will force reload any page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPING                                 *ivcs-page*

Each page comes with some built-in functionality that can be invoked by key
mapping that are described in the following sections. It's easy to add new key
mapping with lua callbacks (see ivcs-customization).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BRANCH                                 *ivcs-branch*

Key     Mode    Function
<cr>    n       Switch to the branch under cursor.

m       n       Mark the current branch under cursor that could be reference in
                other functions. There can be at most two marks.


i       n       Start editing mode such that the buffer becomes modifiable. On
                |:w|, the branches will be renamed according to the current
                buffer content.

o       n       Start editing mode such that the buffer becomes modifiable. On
                |:w|, any new branch names added will be created. If there's no
                mark, the created branch is based on the current git branch. If
                there's 1st mark, the marked branch would be the base branch.

X       n, v    Force delete the current (or visually selected) branches.

r       n, v    Rebase the current (or visually selected) branch(es) onto the
                target commit. If there is no mark, the target commit is the
                commit pointed by HEAD. If there's 1st mark, the target commit
                is the branch under the 1st mark. When visually selecting
                multiple branches, the whole chain of branch would be rebased in
                top-down order. When rebasing the first branch, by default git
                finds a merge base between it and the target commit. However, if
                there's a 2nd mark, it is used as the merge base. This is useful
                when dealing with rebase conflict. On conflict, the rebase stops
                and a temporary branch is created pointing to the branch that
                cause conflict. After fixing the conflict, that temporary branch
                should be the new merge base and can be marked (2nd mark) to
                facilitate the rest rebase work.

s       n       Show (`git show`) the commit under cursor.

R       n       Reset to the commit under cursor. A menu will show up for
                following instruction.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOG                                    *ivcs-log*

<cr>    n       Switch to the commit under cursor. A menu might show up for
                selecting the branch/sha.

m       n       Mark the current commit under cursor that could be reference in
                other functions. There can be at most one mark.

s       n       Show (`git show`) the commit under cursor.

R       n       Reset to the commit under cursor. A menu will show up for
                following instruction.

r       n, v    Rebase the current (or visually selected) commit(s) onto the
                target commit. If there is no mark, the target commit is the
                commit pointed by HEAD. If there's 1st mark, the target commit
                is the branch under the 1st mark. Note that the merge base is
                always the parent commit of the last selected commit. If in
                normal mode, this is equivalent to cherry picking the commit
                under cursor to the target commit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS                                 *ivcs-status*  

<cr>    n       :edit| the current file.

t       n       `:tab drop` the current file.

H       n,v     Stage (`git add`) the current (or visually selected) file(s).

L       n,v     Unstage (`git restore --restored`)  the current (or visually
                selected) file(s).

X       n,v     Discard (`git restore`) the current (or visually selected)
                file(s).

C       n,v     Clear (`git clean -ffd`) the current (or visually selected)
                untracked file(s).

cc      n       Commit change. Opening COMMIT_MESSAGE. If the file is written by
                |:w|, `git commit` runs when the window is closed. Note that
                |:x| does not work if you don't modify the commit message. This
                is because |:x|, unlike |:wq| does not write to the file if the
                buffer is not modified.

ca      n       Like `cc`, except that the commit is amended (`git commit --amend`).

cA      n       Like `ca`, except that a temporary branch is created pointing to
                the commit before amend. Useful if you want to rebase the
                descendent commits onto the amended commit. 

dh      n       Opening |diff| floating windows to show the diff between
                worktree and the index for the current file. Note that the
                worktree buffer is modifiable and savable.

dd      n       Opening |diff| floating windows to show the diff between
                worktree and the stage for the current file. Note that 
                worktree buffer is modifiable and savable. The stage buffer is
                modifiable. Any change made to the stage buffer will reflect to
                the stage area, thus achieving partial stage (`git add -i`).

===============================================================================
Customization                           *ivcs-customization*

All customization is done via the `ivcs.setup` lua function, which take two
arguments: the vcs name and the config. `vcs` needs to be a lua table or a
string. Currently only supported string value is `git`. An example of
configuring for the `git` module is listed below.

```lua
local ivcs = require("ivcs")
local igit = require("ivcs.vcs.git")

ivcs.setup("git", {
	branch = {
		-- Mapping takes arbitrary lua function with no argument.
		mapping = {
			n = {
				["a"] = function()
					print(igit.branch.parse_line())
				end,
			},
			v = {},
		},
		-- Default args for the branch command.
		args = { "-v" },
		buf_enter_reload = true,
		-- Whether to show up a confirmation menu for rebase.
		confirm_rebase = true,
	},
	log = {
		mapping = { n = {}, v = {} },
		-- Default args for the log command.
		args = { "--oneline", "--branches", "--graph", "--decorate=short" },
		-- Whether to reload the buffer on BufEnter. Not recommended since the
		-- log can be very long.
		buf_enter_reload = false,
		-- Whether to show up a confirmation menu for rebase.
		confirm_rebase = false,
	},
	status = {
		mapping = { n = {}, v = {} },
		-- Default args for the status command.
		args = { "-s" },
		buf_enter_reload = true,
	},
})
```
